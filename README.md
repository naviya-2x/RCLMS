## 🖨️ Zebra ZD230 3-Across Thermal Roll Studio (30mm × 15mm)

### 1. Physical Roll Calibration
- **Stickers per row**: 3 stickers aligned in one line across the continuous thermal roll.
- **Individual sticker dimensions**: **30mm width × 15mm height**.
- **Total line width across roll**: **96mm** (30mm + 3mm gap + 30mm + 3mm gap + 30mm = 96mm).
- **Zebra ZD230 Resolution**: 203 DPI (8 dots/mm)
  - `^PW768` (96mm * 8 = 768 dots print width)
  - `^LL120` (15mm * 8 = 120 dots label length)
  - Slot 1 (Left): X = 12 dots (~1.5mm)
  - Slot 2 (Center): X = 276 dots (~34.5mm)
  - Slot 3 (Right): X = 540 dots (~67.5mm)

### 2. 3-Book Queue & Buffer Automation
- **Automatic 3-Across Waiting Logic**: The system stages incoming books in a real-time buffer (`Slot 1`, `Slot 2`, `Slot 3`).
- **Auto-Ready / Print Alert**: Once 3 books are queued (or multiples of 3), the 3-sticker line lights up as **"3/3 Full Row Ready"** with 1-click print or automatic web dispatch.
- **⚡ Force Print Partial Row**: If only 1 or 2 books are entered and you want to print immediately without waiting for 3, click **"⚡ Force Print One/Partial"** — the ZPL prints the exact active slots without paper wastage or margin drift.

### 3. Direct Web ZPL Commands
- **Direct Web Dispatch**: Transmits raw ZPL-II directly to the Zebra ZD230 via local Zebra Browser Print service (`http://127.0.0.1:9100/write` or `https://localhost:9101/write`).
- **Network Raw IP Socket (Port 9100)**: Direct connection configuration for network-attached Zebra printers (e.g. `192.168.1.100:9100`).
- **Web Thermal Driver Print**: Pixel-perfect `@media print` CSS calibrated with `@page { size: 96mm 15mm; margin: 0; }`.
- **Copy & Download**: 1-click copy ZPL code or download `.zpl` script for Zebra Setup Utilities, CUPS, or terminal piping (`nc 192.168.1.100 9100 < label.zpl`).
